# Contributing

Andrea, Will, and I welcome contributions to Tabi-clock!

We accept issues and pull requests for both bugs and feature requests. If your feature is larger (like a new plugin), We suggest creating a new issue to propose the new feature before you start.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, try to be as detailed as possible.

* For bugs, this could include:
	* The steps required to reproduce the bug.

* For feature requests, this could include:
	* Details of how the new feature should work
	* Links to supporting examples, references or documentation


Thank you for your help!
